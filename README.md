Repository for notebooks for the CAFE emotional classification project.

I've revisited these analyses as part of a brownbag series in 2022 comparing
simple linear methods to more complex alternatives.

The original analyses were tested for functionality on a Unix (Ubuntu 16.04)
machine. OpenCV frameworks were at that time limited to Python 2.7, and
parallelization code was optimized for use on an IMB Intel powerstation.

New code was produced as part of a one-day hackathon investigating the potential
for applying neural networks to problems with existing solutions with simpler
models. Code is not optimized, nor is it particularly pretty. All code is
permitted for sharing.
